## Java Development Kit (JDK)
The Java Development Kit (JDK) is a software development environment used for developing Java applications and applets. It contains the Java Runtime Environment (JRE), an interpreter/loader (java), a compiler (javac), an archiver (jar), a documentation generator (javadoc) and other tools needed in Java development.
